# Java Generics Bound Example

This example demonstrates the use of generics with bounded wildcards in Java. It covers unbounded wildcards, upper bounds, lower bounds, and the concept of PECS (Producer Extends, Consumer Super).

## Java Code

```java
package com.webbertech.java;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenericsBoundExample {

    /*
     * Unbounded Wildcards: ?
     * 
     * The following does not work and 
     * neither does it work if you use List<?> as function argument.
     * 
     *  List<?> stuff = new ArrayList<>();
     *  stuff.add("abc");
     *  stuff.add(new Object());
     *  stuff.add(3);
     *  int numElements = stuff.size();
     * 
     * Upper bound
     * List<? extends Number> 
     * 
     * Lower bound
     * List<? super Object> 
     * The example below will work, because no class will be the super class of object, so
     * it has to be object itself.
     * 
     * Multiple bounds
     * 
     * One final note before looking at examples from the Java 8 API. A type parameter can have multiple bounds. The bounds are separated by an ampersand when they are defined.
     * 
     * T extends Runnable & AutoCloseable
     * 
     * You can have as many interface bounds as you like, but only one can be a class. If you have a class as a bound, it must be first in the list.
     * 
     * PECS
     * The term PECS stands for "Producer Extends, Consumer Super", which is an odd acronym coined by Joshua Block in his Effective Java book but provides a mnemonic on what to do. It means that if a parameterized type represents a producer, use extends. If it represents a consumer, use super. If the parameter is both, don’t use wildcards at all — the only type that satisfies both requirements is the explicit type itself.
     * 
     * The advice boils down to:
     * 
     * Use extends when you only get values out of a data structure
     * 
     * Use super when you only put values into a data structure
     * 
     * Use an explicit type when you plan to do both

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<? super Object> stuff = new ArrayList<>();
        stuff.add("abc");
        stuff.add(new Object());
        stuff.add(3);
        stuff.forEach(System.out::println);

        // Lower bound example
        List<? super Number> stuff1 = new ArrayList<>();
        stuff1.add(1);
        stuff1.add(1.2D);
        stuff1.forEach(System.out::println);

        List<? extends Number> stuff2 = new ArrayList<>();
        // stuff2.add(1); you can't do this as when it extracts, it does not know what type it is.
        // stuff2.add(1.2D);
        stuff2.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
